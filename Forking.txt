From the Github documentation:  A fork is a copy of a repository. Forking a repository allows you to freely experiment with changes without affecting the original project.
Most commonly, forks are used to either propose changes to someone else's project or to use someone else's project as a starting point for your own idea.

By forking someone else's repo, you get a copy to which you have write access, i.e. to which you can push your contributions. The entire workflow goes something like this:
1. Identify an area in Bob's repo that can be improved.
2. Fork that repo.
3.Make a clone of your fork on your local machine.
4. In that clone, make changes, run tests, create commits (possibly on a new branch), etc.
5. Optionally, once you're happy with your amendments to Bob's code, make your work more presentable: tidy/squash your commits, write good commit messages that respect the style of Bob's repo. You may also want to rebase your branch to that of Bob's repo.
6. Push to your fork.
7. Issue a pull request to Bob, and wait for him to review it.
8. Push more commits to your fork until Bob is satisfied with your work.
9. Bob merges your pull request; your work gets integrated into his GitHub repo.
10. Champagne! Your work was not in vain.
11. To save space on GitHub servers, and if you don't intend to contribute to Bob's repo any time soon, you can safely delete your fork.
